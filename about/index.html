	<h1>Hi there, I'm Darryl Mitchell!</h1>
	<p>IT professional with nearly a decade of experience designing and supporting mission-critical systems. My experience as a consulting engineer focused in messaging and datacenter technologies has given me a wide array of "people skills" not typically found in the sysadmin field. I'm happiest when solving problems, whether business or technical in nature, and communicating solutions to both technical and non-technical people.</p>
